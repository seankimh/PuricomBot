# Discord Filter Bot
I created a Discord Bot that filters out curse words. This was made to keep Discord servers as friendly environments for all people.
# node_modules
This folder holds all the dependencies needed to connect to the Discord API and the Discord Bot itself.
# src
This folder contains all the code written that functions to filter out cursewords. All code was written using JavaScript.
